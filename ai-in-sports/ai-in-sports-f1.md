# Overview

This lab demonstrates the capabilities of predictive AI. Predictive AI involves using statistical analysis and machinelearning(ML) to identify patterns, anticipate behaviors, and forecast upcoming events. In this case, the lab shows you how to predict the results of a Formula 1 World 
Championship.

# Learning objectives

After completing this lab, you should be able to:

- Build a machine learning model to predict outcomes.
- Deploy and test the machine learning model.

# Dataset

This lab uses the [Formula 1 Racing Data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jtrotman/formula-1-race-data) dataset which contains race data from 1950 to 2026 race 1 (Australia). **Tip:** Right-click the link to open the link in a new tab.

## Files used from the dataset

| File               | Description           | Purpose                                                                 |
| ------------------ | --------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `results.csv`      | Race results data     | Contains finishing positions, points, and race outcomes for each driver |
| `races.csv`        | Race metadata         | Includes race dates, and circuits names                                 |
| `drivers.csv`      | Driver information    | Driver names, nationalities, and biographical data                      |

| `status.csv`       | Race status codes     | Finish status descriptions (e.g., "Finished", "Accident", "Engine")     |

## Data preparation process

The datasets were combined and refined by performing comprehensive data engineering and feature extraction to prepare the raw F1 dataset for machine learning models.

## Feature engineering pipeline

The data refinery process enriches the base dataset with the following calculated features:

### 1. **On the podium: `is_podium`**

- **Type:** Boolean (0/1)
- **Purpose:** Identifies if a driver finished in the top 3 positions (podium finish)
- **Use Case:** Binary classification models to predict podium probability

### 2. **Driver Age: `driver_age`**

- **Type:** Numeric (years)
- **Calculation:** Computed from driver's date of birth and race date
- **Purpose:** Captures driver experience and performance correlation with age

### 3. **Historical Track Performance: `hist_track_points`**

- **Type:** Aggregated statistics per driver-circuit combination
- **Metrics:** Average finishing position, podium rate, DNF rate at specific circuits
- **Purpose:** Leverages driver familiarity and past performance at each track

### 4. **Momentum Indicator: `momentum_3`**

- **Type:** Rolling average metric
- **Window:** Previous 3 races in the current season
- **Metrics:** Average finishing position, points scored, consistency
- **Purpose:** Captures recent form and performance trends

## Output datasets

The refined data is exported to multiple formats optimized for different prediction tasks:

| Output File            | Description                          | Column to predict |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `f1_resultsTill24_TargetPosition.csv` | Refined dataset (2014-2024) to predict driver's position on podium |`target pos` |
| `f1_resultsTill24_IsPodium.csv` | Refined dataset (2014-2024) to predict if the driver will be on the podium | `is_podium` |
| `f1_resultsTill24_points.csv` | Refined dataset (2014-2024) to predict how many points the driver is awarded | `points` |
