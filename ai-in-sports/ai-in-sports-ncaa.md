   - **WAB** measures a team's resume strength by comparing their actual record against how an average bubble team (that is, a team on the verge of making or missing the tournament) would perform against the same schedule.
   - **SEED** is the official ranking (1 through 16) assigned to a team by the NCAA Selection Committee when the tournament bracket is created.
   - **G** stands for games that are played and represents the total number of games a team that is played during the season (typically including the regular season and conference tournaments).

   The following table compares the features.

   | Feature | Type | Focus | Use Case |
   | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
   | **BARTHAG** | Efficiency | Predicts future performance and strength. | Best for predicting "upsets." |
   | **WAB** | Achievement | Measures the quality of the resume. | Best for predicting if a team gets in. |
