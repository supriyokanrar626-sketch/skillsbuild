<!-- >Lab: Prompt a foundation model in the Prompt Lab<-->

# Disclaimer

Please note that some of the outputs that you will generate will not match the outputs discussed in this lab. Your goal is not to recreate the outputs line by line but to get hands on experience using the Prompt Lab, prompting a foundation model, and see how changing different settings and parameters can influence the results.

The reason for differing results is because watsonx.ai is being developed and released in an agile manner. In addition to the above, the web interface is likely to change over time. Therefore, the screenshots used in this lab may not always look exactly like what you see. You can expect to encounter some of the following:

- Additional foundation models in the library list.
- Changes in the user interface (location of buttons, text for various fields)
- Additional tabs/buttons (especially when the Tuning Studio is rolled out)

These differences should not affect how the labs work.

There are three changes, however, that can affect the results:

- Foundation models can be very sensitive to input. If you enter slightly different text than what the exercise is using (even if it is just one single word), the outcome can be different.
- The foundation models are tuned continuously. If the models themselves are updated, then results may vary.
- The sample prompts might change (more can be added, or updated with new text). Since prompt examples are used heavily in this lab, this can affect what you might see. To mitigate that, the prompt example text used will be provided in a gray text box. If you select a prompt example and the text is different, simply copy the given text into various input fields.

# Learning objectives

In this lab, you will complete the following tasks:

- Contrast the different Prompt Lab modes.
- Compare the strengths and weaknesses of different models.
- Test different configuration parameters to how they influence a model in generating output.
- Differentiate zero-shot prompting, one-shot prompting, and few-shot prompting.
- Generate lists with foundation models.
- Save prompts and prompt sessions.
- Restore a saved prompt to an earlier state via prompt history.
- Save prompts to a Jupyter notebook and work with the Jupyter notebook.

**Note**: This lab does not provide an overview of the watsonx user interface. The videos in the course provide several examples of how to navigate the user interface.

# Summary

At the end of this lab, you will be able to open a new Prompt Lab session and navigate the watsonx.ai interface, including selecting and experimenting with different foundation models. You will understand the importance of prompt engineering and how to modify prompts familiar with zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot prompting techniques and how to use them effectively. Additionally, you will learn to adjust inference parameters such as temperature, top P, and top K to influence model outputs. You will also be able to generate structured outputs like lists, and use stop sequences to control model generation. Finally, you will know how to save prompts and prompt sessions, and understand the importance of testing model outputs, especially for code-based tasks.

5. Save your work as a prompt session with the name:
   ```
   granite model prompt
   ```

## Task 2b: Specify stopping criteria

Follow these steps to specify a stop sequence:

1. Click the **Model parameters** icon ![Model parameters icon](images/parameters.svg "Model parameters icon").
1. Type the following keystrokes in the *Stop sequences* field: `press the return or enter key twice`<br/>![Stop sequence characters](images/stop-sequence-02.png "Stop sequence characters")
1. Click the **+** icon to add the sequence. The following image shows the **Stop sequences** field:</br>![Stop sequence](images/stop-sequence-new.png "Stop sequence")
1. Click **Generate**. The following image shows the output which no longer includes the extra text as the model recognizes the stop sequence and ceases to generate anything after that sequence.<br/>
   <img src="images/response-stop.png" width="50%" alt="Output image" title="Output image">
1. Save your work as a prompt session with the name:
   ```
   Stop criteria prompt
   ```

[Back to the top](#top)

### Explore further

- Remove the stop sequence by clicking **X**. What if you specify just one curly right bracket instead? Does this criteria behave as expected?
- Remove the previous stop sequence. What if you specify 2 curly right brackets (with no carriage return in between), using this stop sequence: `}}`. Does this criteria behave as expected?

1. When prompted, paste your API key, and press **Enter**.<br/><img src="images/setup.png" width="50%" alt="Notebook image" title="Notebook image">
1. Run the cell in the _Defining the model id_ section which specifies the model that you are using. See [Supported foundation models in watsonx.ai](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/analyze-data/fm-models.html?context=wx) for a complete list of supported foundation models.
1. Run the cell in the _Defining the model parameters_ section which sets the model parameters what will influence the result. You set these parameters in the Prompt Lab before saving your work as a Jupyter notebook. You can change these parameters to experiment and see how they can affect the output. For example, try changing the values of *max_new_tokens* in combination with different values of *repetition_penalty*; and changing values of *top_p* and *top_k*.<br/><img src="images/model-parameters.png" width="50%" alt="Notebook image" title="Notebook image">
1. Run the cell in the _Defining the project id or space id_ section which uses the project id or space id where the notebook runs.
1. Run the cell in the _Defining the Model object_ section which defines the model object using the defined properties.
1. Run the cell in the _Defining the inferencing input_ section which includes your prompt input that you specified in the Prompt Lab. You can change this input text to experiment with different results.
   - From the model’s point of view, everything between the pair of triple double quotes (“””) is the prompt.
   - This is a one-shot prompt You can use this notebook to quickly test out a few-shot example – simply insert another sample section in the cell.
   - The words Input and Output are not fixed; you can change them. For example, you could change **Output** to **Summarize** or **Conclusion**.
1. Run the cell in the _Execution_ section which pairs the defined model object with the input to generate the response.<br/><img src="images/execution02.png" width="100%" alt="Notebook image" title="Notebook image">
