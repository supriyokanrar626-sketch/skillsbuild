# Task 3: Process and analyze data

Watsonx provides multiple methods for preprocessing data to help ensure its suitability for machine learning. Depending on the use case, data transformation might be required before applying machine learning algorithms. Performing exploratory data analysis beforehand is recommended to better understand the dataset and its characteristics.

**Note**: If you have issues obtaining the example notebook or the final datasets for this task, the IBM team can provide them.

## Task 3a: Run a Python notebook in your project

Using a notebook with custom code provides maximum flexibility for data analysis and transformation. Notebooks can also be scheduled to run automatically, for example, when a new data asset is added to a project space, the notebook will run using the most recent data.

Follow these steps to import the example notebook, and run the cells in the notebook:

1. Click the **Asset** tab.
1. Click **New asset** to add the notebook to your project.
2. In the list of assets that you can create, select **Work with data and models in Python or R notebooks**.
3. In this case, import a notebook from a **URL**.
4. In the _Name_ field, type:
   ```
   Data preparation
   ```

1. In the _Notebook URL_ field, paste the following link:

   ```
   https://raw.githubusercontent.com/academic-initiative/skillsbuild/refs/heads/main/watsonx/files/data-preparation.ipynb
   ```

1. Click **Create**, and then wait for the notebook to load.
2. Select the first cell in the notebook, and click the **Run** icon ![Run](images/run-icon.svg "Run") to import the libraries.
3. Run the code in the second cell to read the data set from the GitHub repository, and see the first 10 rows of the data set.
   
   The data set contains IoT Sensor data that you can use to predict equipment failure. Sensors mounted on devices, such as IoT devices, automated manufacturing, such as robot arms, process monitoring, and control equipment, all collect and transmit time stamped data on a continuous basis.

4. Run the cell in the _Are there missing values?_ section to see any rows with missing values.
5. Run the two cells in the _How balanced is the data set?_ section. The data set is considered to have a mild imbalance because there are fewer rows where the sensor failed (fail=0) than rows where the sensor didn’t fail (fail=1).
6. Run the two cells in the _Is the data categorical or numerical?_ section. The first cell in this section counts the number of distinct, non-null elements in each column or row of a data frame.
7. Run the cells in the _Analyze the correlation between the predictor and target variable_ section, and review the results:
    1. Separate the categorical and numerical variables as well as the target.
    2. Encode the categorical variables by converting them to category codes.
    3. Calculate the dependency between the target and the categorical variables.
    4. Calculate the dependencies between the target and the numerical variables.
    5. Print the dependencies for the numerical variables.
    6. Print the dependencies for the categorical variables.
8. Run the cell in the _Extract a subset of the data_ section. The resulting smaller data set is necessary for testing the deployed model later.
9. In the _Save the data to your project space_ section, follow these steps:
    1. Click **More icon** ![More](images/overflow-menu.svg "More") **> Insert project token**.
    2. Run the cell to set the variables containing your project ID and token.
    3. Run the cell to _Save the training data set_ file.
    4. Run the cell to _Save the test data set_ file.
10. Click the sandbox project name to return to the project’s _Assets_ tab to see the two data sets:

- iot_sensor_data_training.csv
- iot_sensor_data_test.csv

## Task 3b: Optional: Build a Data Refinery flow

You can build a data refinery flow by using a graphical user interface. Follow these steps to open the data set in Data Refinery.

1. From the project’s _Assets_ tab, click the **iot_sensor_data_training.csv** data set to preview the data.
2. Click **Prepare data** to open the data set in Data Refinery.

### How balanced is the data set?

1. Click the **Profile** tab.
2. Scroll to the **fail** column.
3. Hover over **0** and **1** bars to see the frequency of each. The data set is considered to have a mild imbalance because there are fewer rows where the sensor failed (fail=0) than rows where the sensor didn’t fail (fail=1).

Refer to the <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdGGxg" target="_blank">Refining data</a> documentation topic to learn how to prepare the data set in the following ways using Data Refinery:

- Separate the categorical and numerical variables as well as the target.
- Encode the categorical variables by converting them to category codes.
- Calculate the dependency between the target and the categorical variables.
- Calculate the dependencies between the target and the numerical variables.
- Show the dependencies for the numerical variables.
- Show the dependencies for the categorical variables.

# Task 4: Build a binary classification model

In this example, you use the iot_sensor_dataset.csv, iot_sensor_dataset_test.csv and some Python code. The data set includes sensor readings and a column indicating whether a sensor has failed (0 or 1). Since the target (fail) column involves distinguishing between two possible outcomes, the data is well-suited for a binary classification model.

## Task 4a: Create a new AutoAI experiment

1. Click the sandbox project name to return to the project’s _Assets_ tab.
1. In your project’s _Assets_ tab, click **New asset > Build machine learning or RAG solutions automatically.**
2. In this case, select **Build a machine learning model**, and click **Next**.
3. For the _Name_, type the following text, and click **Create**.
   ```
   Sensor experiment
   ```

## Task 4b: Configure the experiment

1. Click **Select from project**.
    1. Select **Data asset > iot_sensor_data_training.csv**.
    1. Click **Select asset**.
2. Select **No** for the _Create a time series analysis?_ question.
3. For the _Prediction_ column, select **fail**. Since you want to predict if the sensor fails, the _fail_ column serves as the target variable, while the remaining columns act as features.

   As expected, AutoAI chose **Binary Classification** for the _Prediction Type_. However, before running the experiment, you can view all of the settings for the AutoAI experiment.

1. Click **Experiment settings**. In the _Experiment Settings_ page, you can customize the experiment.

   The **Prediction** settings allow customization of the prediction type (keep binary classification unchanged), selection of the positive class, choice of the optimized metric, and specification of algorithms for the experiment. The positive class should be set to `1`, indicating that a `1` in the dataset represents a sensor failure.

   The **Data source** settings allow configuration of key aspects, including dataset properties, feature selection, and the splitting strategy for training, testing, and validation

   The **Runtime** settings show you more details about your experiment, but you cannot change these settings here.

   | Settings Category | Description |
   |-------------------|-------------|
   | Prediction settings | Allows customization of prediction type, selection of positive class, choice of optimization metric, and specification of algorithms for the experiment. The positive class should be set to 1, indicating that a '1' in the dataset represents a sensor failure. |
   | Data source settings | Configures key aspects, including dataset properties, feature selection, and the splitting strategy for training, testing, and validation. |
   | Runtime settings | Displays more details about your experiment. |

1. Take some time to review the _Prediction_, _Data source_, and _Runtime_ panels. In particular, review the following settings, and then click **Cancel** when you are done.

   - Optimized metric
   - Algorithms to include
   - Algorithms to use
   - All settings on the _Data source_ panel > _General_ tab

   Refer to <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdGaXi" target="_blank">Configure experiment settings</a> for detailed documentation on the experiment settings. 

1. Click **Run experiment**, and wait while the _Progress map_ and _Pipeline leaderboard_ are filled in.

## Task 4c: Analyze the experiment results

AutoAI automatically builds different pipelines and compare them to each other based on the metrics specified in the experiment settings. In this example, the pipelines are optimized and ranked for accuracy & run time.

You see the top performing pipeline in the leaderboard. The table shows you the algorithm used, the accuracy, the enhancements (<a href="https://ibm.biz/BdGaXG" target="_blank">hyperparameter optimization</a> and <a href="https://ibm.biz/BdGaXK" target="_blank">feature engineering</a>) as well as the build time for each pipeline candidate.

<br/>![Progress map and leaderboard in AutoAI](images/ml-ds-autoai01.png)

1. When the experiment completes, click the **Pipeline comparison**. This chart compares the 8 pipelines based on different metrics.
2. Click the **Rank preferences** icon ![Rank preferences](images/settings-adjust.svg "Rank preferences") to change the _Metric_ and _Score type_ to update the metric chart and the leaderboard.
3. Select the top performing pipeline in the *Pipeline leaderboard* to see the detailed results.
4. Click the **Model information** page. This page displays basic information.
5. Click the **Feature summary** page. AutoAI chooses only the most important features. Here you see the importance score of each selected feature.
6. Select the **Model evaluation** page. This page shows you the quality measures and associated scores. The holdout score is the score obtained from evaluating the trained model on a separate holdout of the data that was not used for the training of the model. The cross-validation score is the average result from multiple training and validation splits. In a balanced dataset, where the data is independent and identically distributed, cross-validation is more reliable as it reduces variance by averaging results across multiple splits.<br/>![Model evaluation](images/ml-ds-autoai02.png)

   The following table provides a quick explanation of the evaluation measures.

   | **Measure** | **Description** | **Note** |
   | --- | --- | --- |
   | Accuracy | Measures how many observations (0 or 1) are correctly classified. | If the dataset is unbalanced, accuracy might not be the best measure because it might be high by consistently predicting 0 or 1. |
   | Area under ROC | Indicates how well the model identifies differences between classes. | Higher scores indicate better model performance with identifying classes |
   | Precision | When the model predicts a sensor failure, how often is it really a sensor failure? | High precision means not many false positives. |
   | Recall | Out of all sensor failures, how many did the model predict? | High recall means not many false negatives. |
   | F1  | The F1 score can be interpreted as a weighted average of the precision and recall values, where an F1 score reaches its best value at 1 and worst value at 0. | &nbsp;A low F1 score is an indication of both poor precision and poor recall. |
   | Average Precision (AP Score) | The AP is the area under the plotted curve of precision against recall. | The higher the AP score the better the model performance. |
   | Log Loss | Indicates how close the prediction probability is to the true value (0 or 1). | The higher the log loss, the worse is the performance of the model. |

1. Click the **Confusion matrix page**. This page displays a matrix showing the predicted values against the actual values from the dataset is shown.<br/>![Confusion matrix](images/ml-ds-autoai03.png)

## Task 4d: Save the model

You are now ready to save and deploy the top performing pipeline to make the model available for predictions on new data. Follow these steps to save the model:

1. For the best performing model, click **Save as**.
2. Select the **Model** asset type.
3. Accept the default name.
4. Click **Create**. The model is saved to the _Assets_ tab in the project.

# Task 6: Optional: Build a model with SPSS Modeler

SPSS Modeler provides a no-code solution for building anomaly detection models, allowing you to quickly identify unusual data points even when the underlying pattern is unknown. This method is unsupervised, meaning it does not require a training dataset with a predefined target variable.

SPSS Modeler’s anomaly detection capability helps identify irregular data points. This capability can be useful during exploratory data analysis, particularly for data auditing before using the data for modeling. The anomaly detection node clusters similar records and flags those records that significantly deviate from the cluster centers. However, it is more of a general-purpose method and might not be the best choice for domain-specific anomaly detection, such as detecting fraudulent transactions in finance or unusual billing patterns in healthcare, where more specialized methods might be needed.

But by using the anomaly node in SPSS Modeler, you can quickly scan datasets for irregularities, making it a valuable tool for detecting anomalies, especially if you have no prior knowledge of the data. For more information, read the detailed description of the <a href="https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsd/nodes/anomalydetection.html?context=wx" target="_blank">Anomaly node</a>.
